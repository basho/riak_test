Time Series tests are organised in sets
ts_A
ts_B
ts_C
etc, etc

Basically, if a ts_A type test fails then there SHOULD also be failures
in ts_B, ts_C series tests as well

Basically fix the ts_A tests first, and that 'should' fix a lot of
ts_B, ts_C etc tests

If you have a failure in say a ts_B test, but no failures in ts_C that
indicates you might not have enough ts_C, ts_D tests written, consider
extending the test suite
