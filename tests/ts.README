Time Series tests are organised in sets
ts_simple
ts_cluster
ts_degraded
etc, etc

Basically, if a ts_simple type test fails then there SHOULD also be failures
in ts_cluster, ts_degraded series tests as well

Basically fix the ts_simple tests first, and that 'should' fix a lot of
ts_cluster, ts_degraded etc tests

If you have a failure in say a ts_cluster test, but no failures in ts_degraded that
indicates you might not have enough ts_degraded, ts_etc tests written, consider
extending the test suite
