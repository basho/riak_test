    %% is found as a last one from RiakEnsembleLeaderElectionAgent,
    %% this instance is currently a standby master. Let’s ‘tail -f’
    %% this log.  This way we’ll see when it’ll gain leadership

    %% Go to the instance that has and entry
    %% ‘INFO RiakEnsembleLeaderElectionAgent: We have gained leadership’
    %% and execute ‘kill <master’s pid>’

    %% Verify that in the standby master’s logs that you tail there are entries like
    %% 15/07/09 02:13:46 INFO RiakEnsembleLeaderElectionAgent: We have gained leadership
    %% 15/07/09 02:13:46 INFO Master: I have been elected leader! New state: RECOVERING
