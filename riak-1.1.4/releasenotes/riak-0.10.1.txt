Riak 0.10.1 Release Notes
----------------------

Riak 0.10.1 addresses two issues:

 - An issue has been fixed, which caused map/reduce queries to never
   be run on the node where the query originated. This both improves
   the efficiency of some queries, as well as fixes map/reduce on
   single-node clusters.

 - The "deps" make target was added as a dependency of the "rel" make
   target, such that "make rel" does the right thing the first time.
