- to get the reporting stuff working, you'll need to have gnuplot
  installed on your local machine, at at least version 4.6.3. If you
  need to install from source, you'll need at least these two deps:

- sudo apt-get install libgd2-xpm-dev libreadline6-dev

- symlink the stuff in perf/reporting to ~/bin/, assuming that is on
  your path.

- drop_caches.sh needs to be visible on the remote machine.  the
  initial version of these scripts assumes that everyone is on the
  same filer.  This isn't going to be true everywhere.  drop is meant
  to contain your username, and be in /etc/sudoers.d/.

- ssh needs to be setup so that the user doesn't need to provide
  credentials.  The current way is that I just generated a bos-local
  key and use that.  This isn't a terrible idea, but should at least
  be automated on setup.


- ~/.riak_test.config should have a harness entry like this:

{rtperf, 
  [
	 {rt_deps, ["/usr/local/basho/evan/riak2.0/deps"]},
	 %% should be really long to allow full bitcasks to 
	 %% come up
	 {rt_max_receive_wait_time, 600000000000000},
	 {test_timeout, 600000000000000},
	 {basho_bench, "/usr/local/basho/evan/basho_bench/"},
	 {basho_bench_statedir, "/tmp/bb_seqstate/"},
	 {rt_retry_delay, 500},
	 {rt_harness, rtperf},
	 {load_intercepts, false},
	 {perf_builds, "/usr/local/basho/evan/"},
	 {perf_loadgens, ["localhost", "r2s24"]},
	 {rtdev_path, []}

]}.

  at least right now.  this will problably change as the configuration
  stuff gets sorted out.  some of these may not be necessary.
  rt_max_receive_wait_time is (could maybe be set to infinity?  maybe by the
  harness?), perf_* and basho_bench* are also critical.  rt_deps
  should maybe be dynamic?
